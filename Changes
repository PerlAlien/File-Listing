2011-02-25 File-Listing 6.00

Initial release of File-Listing as a separate distribution.  The File::Listing
module used to be bundled with the libwww-perl distribution.

Since libwww-perl-5.837 File::Listing has been made able to deal with listings
full of table markup (like what we find at http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/).
